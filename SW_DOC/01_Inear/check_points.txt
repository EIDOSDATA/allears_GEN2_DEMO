** Check Points

1. Detect In case and Out of case
	1) See phy_state.c, appPhyStateHandleMessage(), CHARGER_MESSAGE_ATTACHED and CHARGER_MESSAGE_DETACHED
	2) See charger_monitor.c, Charger_UpdateConnected()
	3) See system_message.h and MESSAGE_CHARGER_CHANGED
	4) System checks VCHG_SENSE pin to detect if device is in case or out of case.
	5) Although charging is complete, if VCHG_SENSE is hight (5V), system can detect current case state exactly

2. Reset when in or Out of case or watchdog
	1) Global definition: INCLUDE_WATCHDOG
	2) See tws_topology_common_primary.rules and tws_topology_common_secondary.rules
	3) See tws_topology_common_primary_rule_functions.h/.c and tws_topology_common_secondary_rule_functions.h/.c ruleTwsTopPriInCaseWatchdogStart() and ruleTwsTopPriInCaseWatchdogStop()
	4) See wathdog.h and wathdog.h
	5) When in case, watchdog start and after time is elapsed watchdog reset works. 
	6) When Out of case, watchdog stops

3. AUL(Application User Level) log
	1) AUL log is used for developers and made when application is implemented
	2) So, in official product, AUL log had better be removed
	3) To remove AUL log, remove AUL_DEBUG_PRINT_ENABLED in global definitions
	

4. Disable Debug Log
	1) It is impossible to disable log
	2) Do not try to disable Hydra log
	3) It is possible to changbe log level, but do not change if possible
		- logging.h
			Change DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL as wish, currently DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL_INFO
	
5. Disable Hydra log
	1) It is impossible to disable Hydra log
	2) Do not try to disable Hydra log
	3) It is possible to changbe log level, but do not change if possible
		- buld_defs.h
			Change HYDRA_LOG_MAX_LEVEL

6. Add Release Build
	1) In QMDE -> Build Settings -> Clone -> Rename "Release"
	2) Properties -> General tab -> DEFS
		- Remove
			AV_DEBUG
			DEBUG
	3) FW image size are not different greatly of Debug and Release
